        <p>The SDSSTP project aims to address the challenge of planning optimal sightseeing tours while ensuring social
          distancing measures are followed. It focuses on developing a routing-type solution that finds the best route
          for visiting a given set of landmarks, with the objective of minimizing the total tour duration while prioritizing
          the safety and well-being of individuals. This includes constraints such as visiting each landmark exactly once,
          starting and ending at the tour office, and minimizing the total tour duration.</p>
        <p>The SDSSTP project recognizes the importance of safe and socially responsible tourism, particularly in the context
          of post-pandemic travel. By leveraging advanced algorithms and search methods, our project offers an innovative
          approach to planning sightseeing tours that adhere to social distancing guidelines, providing a unique and valuable
          solution for the tourism industry.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Solution Implementation</h2>
        <p>The project offers a comprehensive implementation of the SDSSTP solution through the use of hyper-heuristics.
          Heuristics include Adjacent Swap, Inversion Mutation, Random Re-insertion, Next Descent,Davis's Hill Climbing, Ordered Crossover, and Cycle Crossover.
          Furthermore, these heuristics are implemented with  various initialisation and evaluation techniques</p>
